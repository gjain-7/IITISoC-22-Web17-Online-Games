ONLINE GAMES WEBSITE
This project comprises of 4 games, namely: TicTacToe, Hangman, Connect 4 and Othello .
We have used HTML, CSS, and JS to make our games and site’s appearance.
This presents any user with all 4 options of these games to start with. After they opt for one of these, they are directed to a localhost site where they can play them.
When a player wins/loses/draws, we have added sounds resembling the result. 
In tictactoe , Othello and Connect-4 , 2 players can play with each other but with the same device.
In Hangman , the player is given limited number of choices to guess a word by choosing its letters randomly.




Experience in IITISOC – IITISOC has been a great opportunity for us. All us team members were pure beginners before we started this project. We are now comfortable with HTML, CSS, and the basics of Javascript. We look forward to building on this and continue learning back-end too, to implement in our future projects.
